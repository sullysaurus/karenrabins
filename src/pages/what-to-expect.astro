            Research suggests that a strong bond between client and therapist plays a crucial role in the effectiveness of treatment. I offer a free 15-minute phone consultation to learn more about your needs, to address questions you may have, and to give you a sense of who I am.  Together, we decide if I am the right person to help you.

          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            In our initial meeting, we'll explore what brought you to therapy, discuss your goals, 
            and begin to understand your unique situation and strengths. This session is generally 60 minutes.

            <p>
              The frequency of sessions is based upon your needs and will be discussed at the intake. 
              Although we discuss goals in the first session, the process is open ended and intended to 
              address your changing needs. You determine what you want to talk about, and I follow your lead. 
              We engage in discussion and work collaboratively. Sessions are 55 minutes.
            </p>
            <p>
              How I respond is determined by what you need. I am an active participant in each discussion 
              and choose when it is best to maintain silence, be directive, ask questions, and give feedback. 
              I also welcome feedback from you so that you get what you needâ€¦For many, asking for what one 
              needs is hard. The therapeutic relationship can be a safe place to step out of one's comfort 
              zone in service of more comfort outside of the office.
