          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            I grew up and lived in New York City until I moved to Raleigh in 2001. I have a Bachelor of Science 
            in Human Development and Family Studies from Cornell University (5/1980). I earned a Master's Degree in Social Work from New York University 
            (5/1986). Over my long career, I have actively pursued ongoing professional training to stay current 
            with neuroscience, therapeutic modalities, and our understanding of mental health and wellness. 
            I emphasize the importance of self-care, which includes attention to emotional, physical, social 
            and spiritual well-being, sleep, diet, and exercise.
          </p>
          
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            I love what I do and feel privileged to hear clients' stories and help them discover a more 
            empowered, contented version of themselves. I'm a lifelong learner, enjoy all kinds of crafts, 
            and as a lover of stories, an avid reader and movie fan. Most treasured is time with family and friends.
