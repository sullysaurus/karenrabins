              I grew up and lived in New York City in a melting pot, diverse
              ethnically and economically. I was aware that some kids in my
              neighborhood did not have a full refrigerator, some kids did not
              have a lot of toys, but we all had great fun playing together.
              These memories laid the groundwork for my clinical social work
              career. I have a Bachelor of Science in Human Development and
              Family Studies from Cornell University. I earned a Master’s Degree
              in Social Work from New York University. My work as a psychiatric
              and school social worker at the start of my career profoundly
              broadened my growing understanding of people’s experiences, our
              differences, and our common humanity.

            <p class="text-base sm:text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed px-4">
              In my practice, I emphasize the importance of self-care, which
              includes attention to emotional, physical, social, and spiritual
              well-being, sleep, diet, and exercise. I pursue professional
              training in neuroscience, therapeutic approaches, and
              social/societal concerns to evolve with science and society.

              Life, my constant teacher, continues to deepen my appreciation for
              the impact that both planned and unplanned experiences have on us,
              shaping who we are, how we feel, and how we perceive our lives.
              During COVID, I began conducting telehealth sessions with adults.
              My professional concentration had been with children and families
              in schools. I loved the therapeutic relationship that developed
              when working one-to-one with adults, which is now the focus of my
              practice.
            </p>
            <p class="text-base sm:text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed px-4">
              I feel fortunate to hear my clients’ stories and to witness their
              growth into more empowered and content individuals. As I help
              them, I also learn from their experiences, which keeps me growing
              professionally and personally--the therapeutic circle of life.
            </p>
            <p class="text-base sm:text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed px-4">
              When not working, I enjoy all kinds of crafts, travel, movies, and
              books—I am a lover of stories. I find my Zen in the quiet beauty
              of lakes and mountains. Most treasured, is time with family and
              friends.

          I strive to create a safe, non-judgmental space where you can explore,
          gain insight and awareness, and learn practical skills to create
          meaningful change.
