              I grew up and lived in New York City until I moved to Raleigh in 2001. I have a Bachelor of Science 
              in Human Development and Family Studies from Cornell University. I earned a Master's Degree 
              in Social Work from New York University. Over my long career, I have actively pursued ongoing 
              professional training to stay current with neuroscience, therapeutic modalities, and our understanding 
              of mental health and wellness. I emphasize the importance of self-care, which includes attention to 
              emotional, physical, social and spiritual well-being, sleep, diet, and exercise.

              As a Licensed Clinical Social Worker in North Carolina with over 30 years in mental health practice, 
              I love what I do and feel privileged to hear clients' stories and help them discover a more 
              empowered, contented version of themselves. I'm a lifelong learner, enjoy all kinds of crafts, 
              and as a lover of stories, an avid reader and movie fan. Most treasured is time with family and friends.
